Introduction:
This assignment was given by Sir Nauman Riaz as part of our Programming Fundamentals (PF) course. The purpose of this task was to practice basic programming concepts in C++ and understand how to write simple programs using correct syntax and structure.
I completed all the required programs in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), where I wrote, compiled, and successfully executed each program. This assignment helped me get practical experience in writing C++ code and understanding how a program runs in actual compiler..
